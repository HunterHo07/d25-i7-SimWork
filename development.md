# SimWork Development Documentation

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animation Libraries**:
  - Framer Motion for UI animations
  - Three.js for 3D environment
  - GSAP for scroll animations
- **State Management**: React Context API and localStorage
- **UI Components**: Custom components with glassmorphism and aurora effects

### Simulated Backend (MVP Phase)
- **Data Storage**: localStorage for user progress and settings
- **Mock API**: JSON files for simulated responses
- **Authentication**: Simulated login/registration (no actual backend)

### Tools & Libraries
- **3D Environment**: Three.js / React Three Fiber
- **Animation**: GSAP, Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Heroicons, custom SVGs
- **Asset Management**: Local assets (no external dependencies)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form

- **Basic Task Engine**: Simulated work tasks with feedback
- **Progress Tracking**: Simple metrics on task completion
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility

### Phase 2
- **Desktop/Mobile Apps**: Native application experience
- **Expanded Scenarios**: More complex, multi-step challenges
- **AI Feedback**: More sophisticated assessment and guidance
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user scenarios
- **Custom Branding**: White-label options for enterprises

### Phase 3
- **VR/AR Integration**: Immersive 3D environment
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiplayer functionality
- **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive performance metrics
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Connect with HR and LMS systems
- **Global Localization**: Multi-language support

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement responsive design for all components
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)
- Comment complex logic and animations
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load components and assets
- Optimize 3D models and animations
- Implement code splitting
- Use Next.js image optimization
- Minimize re-renders with memoization

### Animation Guidelines
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful
- Ensure animations don't interfere with usability
- Provide reduced motion options for accessibility
- Use hardware-accelerated properties when possible
- Maintain 60fps target for all animations

## Usage Guide

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Start the production server: `npm start`

### Adding New Features
1. Create components in the appropriate directory
2. Update page files to include new components
3. Add any required assets to the assets directory
4. Update mock data in the data directory if needed
5. Test on multiple devices and browsers

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Interaction testing (mouse, keyboard, touch)
- Animation performance testing

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for user flows
- Performance tests for animations and 3D rendering

## Deployment

### Hosting Options
- Vercel (recommended for Next.js)
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- GitHub Pages

### Deployment Process
1. Push changes to the main branch
2. Automatic build and deployment via CI/CD
3. Verify deployment on staging environment
4. Promote to production
