![SimWork Logo](./public/images/logo.png)

## Revolutionizing Skill Development Through Immersive Simulation

SimWork is an AI-driven, immersive "future of work" game that transforms how companies train employees and assess candidates. By combining real-world tasks with adaptive difficulty and real-time analytics, SimWork creates an engaging environment where users can develop practical skills that directly transfer to their professional lives.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional training and assessment methods are failing both companies and individuals:

- **Wrong Hires, Wasted Money**: Companies waste resources on candidates who interview well but can't perform on the job
- **Fake Skills, No Real Test**: There's no hands-on environment to prove candidates can handle daily work tasks
- **Slow, Inefficient Hiring**: Too many rounds of interviews and theoretical tests that don't reflect real job requirements
- **No KPI or Proof of Skill**: Current systems lack real-time performance tracking and objective skill measurement

## Our Solution

SimWork creates a gamified, immersive environment that simulates real workplace scenarios:

- **Immersive, Multi-Role Game World**: A 3D office with stations for different roles (Developer, Designer, PM, Data Entry, AI Engineer)
- **AI-Powered Adaptivity**: Dynamic task complexity adjustment and intelligent guidance
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking of performance metrics and personalized feedback
- **Authentic Work Tasks**: Challenges that mirror actual job responsibilities, from coding to design to data analysis

## Key Features

- **Interactive 2.5D Environment**: Navigate a stylized workspace with different department zones
- **Role-Based Challenges**: Tasks tailored to specific job functions and skill levels
- **Embedded Tools**: Simulated IDE, design canvas, and data manipulation interfaces
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback on performance metrics
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: AI-powered challenge generation that grows with the user
